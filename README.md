Sticky Event Listener
================

A small javascript plugin for adding an event listener for sticky elements, without the need for an onscroll listener.

### Licence
The Sticky Event Listener plugin is licensed under the [CC-BY-4.0 license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

### Development
This project uses [Gulp(4)](http://gulpjs.com/) to compile and minify Typescript to Javascript.
If you are unfamiliar with Gulp, check [this tutorial](https://travismaynard.com/writing/getting-started-with-gulp) on how to get started.<br />
Run `gulp watch` in the command-line to put a watch on the files and run all scripts immediately after saving your changes.
